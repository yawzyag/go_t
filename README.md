Go (also known as Golang) is an open source programming language developed by Google. It is a statically-typed compiled language. Go supports concurrent programming, i.e. it allows running multiple processes simultaneously. This is achieved using channels, goroutines, etc. Go has garbage collection which itself does the memory management and allows the deferred execution of functions.
